# Getting started with Github

Github is used for code collaboration and version control. The basic idea is that code lives on branches. Often times, the "master" branch is the most up-to-date and stable version. Other branches are made whenever you want to work on things. In our case, we might want to have a naming convention for our branches (your_name/name_of_branch), so it's easier to look for things. Once you've made your desired code edits (on your branch), add your files, and commit your changes. This will update your branch. Once you're satisfied with your branch, submit a pull request to sync the "Master" branch with your updates. See the links for a more detailed walkthrough.

## Other Useful features
* Projects Tab
  * Here you can create and take new tasks. This is helpful in organizing who is doing what and when.
* Issues
  * If you see any issues/bugs with the current code, just make an issue here.
* Wiki
  * A place to put tutorials relevant to the code base. We might place a few things here.
